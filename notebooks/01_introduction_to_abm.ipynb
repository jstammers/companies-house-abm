    "\n",
    "The UK Economy ABM builds on Companies House data to create a large-scale agent-based model grounded in complexity economics. Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **~5 million Firm agents** initialized from real Companies House data\n",
    "- **~30 million Household agents** (synthetic population calibrated to ONS)\n",
    "- **Complexity economics** framework: emergence, bounded rationality, networks\n",
    "- **Future Rust core** for high-performance simulation at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status (v0.1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Phase 1 of the implementation. Currently available:\n",
    "- Companies House XBRL data ingestion\n",
    "- Agent base classes (Firm, Household)\n",
    "- Documentation and architecture"
